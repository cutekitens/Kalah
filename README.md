Project completed for Computer Science 32: Introduction to Computer Science II taken Winter 2019

Created a console application using Xcode where each player is trying to get as many beans as possible into their pot. There are three different types of player: the human player (player interacting with console), bad player (computer player making random moves), and the smart player (computer player choosing the best move each turn).
